<h3>Welcome to all my websites. This website that contains all of my websites was meant for my friends, however, if you came here by accident, you are still more than welcome to view these websites. At first I wanted to make separate websites and domains, however, I couldn't figure out how to do that and put all webpages into one website as just an html file. Here are some of my most popular and favorite websites.</h3>
