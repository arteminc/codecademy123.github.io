*NOTICE*
<br />
As most of us don't check our e-mails daily(and because a can't go onto Google in China), I've decided to post the updates and other stuff here on this page. You will no longer recieve e-mails about the updates of the database.

WORDS FROM THE DEVELOPER
<br />
As you all know this database thing began when Artem asked me to make it. He drew a very simple picture and showed it to me. I created the website according to the picture. It had a few JavaScript functions that allowed the user to log in and log out. And on the home page the only words were: Log Out, Hi. It had a white background and black text. But as I improved it and added features and pages like encrypted passwords, jokes, games, etc. Then it became as it now is, and I am extemely proud.
